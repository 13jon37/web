      <p>Hello, my name is Jon. 
        I have lived in Virginia all my life.
        I got my first introduction to programming at age 15 as a 
        freshman in high school while taking a robotics class. I learned

        I continued an interest in programming with C++ on and off until my senior year of high school, since then I have been 
        consistently programming. Recent languages I have been learning and using include: C, C++, python, JavaScript/TypeScript, C#, and Java.
